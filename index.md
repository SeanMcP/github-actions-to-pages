# Title

This is some body text with [a link](https://seanmcp.com).

Will this work? **Let's find out!**

## Update

The preivous iteration worked, but now I want to see if I can build to a hidden directory to keep the repo as clean as possible.

I changed the output directory via the `build` script and updated the GitHub Action reference. With that directory in the `.gitignore`, **will it still work?**

## Update 2

Will [linking to other pages](./page-two) work? Let's find out!
