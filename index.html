<h2>Update</h2>
<p>The preivous iteration worked, but now I want to see if I can build to a hidden directory to keep the repo as clean as possible.</p>
<p>I changed the output directory via the <code>build</code> script and updated the GitHub Action reference. With that directory in the <code>.gitignore</code>, <strong>will it still work?</strong></p>
<h2>Update 2</h2>
<p>Will <a href="./page-two">linking to other pages</a> work? Let's find out!</p>
